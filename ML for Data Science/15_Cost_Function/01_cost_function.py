'''A cost function is an important parameter that determines how well a machine learning model performs for a given dataset

   Cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in estimating the relationship between X(input) and Y(Output) Parameter'''
   
'''Types of Cost Function:
   (1.) Regression Cost Function:  In regressional analysis, output is continuous in nature
   (2.) Classification Cost Function:  In Classification analysis, output is classified in nature e.g; Yes No, True False, etc'''
   
'''[Regression Cost Function]:
   Regression models are used to make a prediction for the continuous variables.
   MSE (Mean Square Error)
   RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
   R^2 Accuracy'''
   
'''[Classification Cost Function]: It is of two types:-
    (1.) Binary Classification Cost Functions
    (2.) Multi-class Classification Cost Function'''
