'''This is a form of regression, that constraints/ regularizes or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero.
   This technique discourages learning a more complex or flexible model, so as to avoid the risk of overfitting.'''
   
   
'''Regularization can be achieved this motive with 2 techniques:->     (1.) Lasoo Regularization[L1]
