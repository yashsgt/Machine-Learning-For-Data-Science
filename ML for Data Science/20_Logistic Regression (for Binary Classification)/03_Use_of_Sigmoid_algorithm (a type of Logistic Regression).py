'''When you put input data for which output data is beyond your binary limits (1 or 0) then at that time if you draw or use
   [linear regression], then the straight line will go above the limit of the output can't be able to predict anything
   so, at that time you must have to use the [Sigmoid Regression algorithm] which makes S shape line in your graph and output beyond your
   limit can also be predicted
   
   (X_input)  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
   (y_output)  0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1'''     # Binary outputs
   
   
'''Note-> Logistics regression uses sigmoid activation function and this sigmoid activation function uses the Linear Regression'''


# Working of Logistic regression:
'''Input Data----> Linear regression  ---->(output data of linear reg)----> Sigmoid function ------> (gives output in True or False)'''
