'''The Classification algorithm is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data

   In classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number
   of classes or groups
   
   Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as target/labels or categories'''

'''There are two types of Classifications:->
   
(1.) Binary Classifier: If the classification problem has only two possible outcomes, then it is called as Binary Classifiers.
                        e.g: SPAM or NOT SPAM,  CAT or DOG, etc
                           
(2.) Multi-class Classifier: If a classification problem has more than two outcomes, then it is called as Multi-Class Classifier
                             e.g: Classification of types of crops, Classification of types of music'''

'''For classification only, you can use only have two algorithms:->     (1.) Naive Bayes        (2.) Logistic Regression'''
