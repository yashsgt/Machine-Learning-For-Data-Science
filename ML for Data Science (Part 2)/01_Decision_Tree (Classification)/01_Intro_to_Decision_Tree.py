'''Decision Tree:-> Decision Tree is a supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred
                    for solving classsification problems.
                    
  In order to build a tree, we use the CART agorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression Tree algorithm
  
  Decision Tree is an non-linear separable algorithm that works for non-linearly separable data
